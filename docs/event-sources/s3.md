## Trigger AWS Lambda from an S3 event

![S3 to AWS Lambda diagram](/img/event-sources/s3-lambda.png)

In this pattern, we will walk through how to trigger AWS Lambda from S3 object events.

## Packages Required

```shellscript install
aws-lambda-java-events
```

## Imports Required

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.events.S3Event;
```

## Function Code

The S3 to Lambda integration is what is known as an asynchronous invoke. Events are forwarded to the Lambda service and processed asynchronously, meaning the caller can continue doing other work.

The _`S3Event`_ object contains a List of _`S3EventNotificationRecord`_ objects. S3 Events are passed to Lambda in batches.

The _`S3EventNotificationRecord`_ object contains both a _`getBucket()`_ and _`getObject()`_ method. It's important to note that the _`key`_ property of the _`S3ObjectEntity`_ will **always** be URL encoded. However, if you need to make a call to the S3 API then you need the URL decoded key string. That's caught me out many times ðŸ˜¢

```java App.java
public class App implements RequestHandler<S3Event, String> {

    public String handleRequest(final S3Event input, final Context context) {

        try {
            // Perform business logic
            input.getRecords().forEach((s3Event) -> {
                var bucketDetails = s3Event.getS3().getBucket();
                var objectDetails = s3Event.getS3().getObject();
            });

        } catch (Exception e) {
            return "ERROR";
        }

        return "OK";
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Remember to URL decode your object key if you need to do any further work with the S3 API.
- Handle errors. If any of the S3 iterations fail, the entire batch will be sent to a dead letter queue
