description: An introduction to the serverless Java website.
---

Why hello there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to serverlessjava.dev. I'm sure you're here to learn about all the things you can build with AWS serverless technologies using Java.

Whether you are brand new to serverless development or a seasoned Java professional this site has a little bit of everything. From building single purpose Lambda functions to running your SpringBoot API's on top of Lambda.

I'd recommend starting with the [Your First Lambda](/docs/category/your-first-lambda) tutorial first. This will give you a good introduction to the structure of a Lambda function. From there, feel free to have a look around.

If you'd like to contribute or noticed one of my inevitable spelling mistakes then please raise an issue on the GitHub repo.

Otherwise, happy coding!

James
