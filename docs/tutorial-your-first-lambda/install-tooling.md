# Install Tooling

AWS provides a range of tools to help enable the development of serverless applications with Java.

## AWS SAM

For the purpose of this initial tutorial you will be using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to build your first Lambda function. Instructions for installing AWS SAM are found in the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html).

Once installed, run the below command to check the CLI tool is installed correctly.

```shellscript install
sam --version
```

For a deep dive into AWS SAM, check out the [SAM pages on this very site](/docs/developer-tooling/aws-sam).
